# course description

The course starts with a brief introduction to React with Typescript, but I leave additional videos on YouTube for further reference (these videos are created by me as well and are an additional 5 hours not included here), then we move on to creating a small project that will serve us well. To practice different component creation patterns, I'll explain several very popular ones and little by little we'll build a robust set of components that we'll deploy to NPM via TSDX. Along the way we go through module separation and lazyload, additionally I give my preferred custom point for working with modules.

Then we explain Formik, validations, Yup and dynamic forms, creating simple reusable components that will help us not to have to write the same thing over and over again.

Later we go to Storybook, we explain what it is, what it can be used for, we create a couple of configurations and then we publish our Storybook in several places, eventually we will create the necessary TypeScript configuration files, modifications in the package.json and configurations with semantic release to carry out a systematized process of creating and updating components using GitHub Actions as an intermediary.

Then we move to build an application made in my React course from zero to expert that has a personalized backend with JWTs, to transform our React application into a PWA, explaining automatic and manual configurations and customizations that allow us to work without an internet connection. our React application, also install it as if it were a Windows, Linux or Mac application.
